Python code to generate "Tiny Amoebas."

Makes convex polygons using [this algorithm](https://cglab.ca/~sander/misc/ConvexGeneration/convex.html), with segments
rendered into a pixel buffer using [this algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_differential_analyzer_(graphics_algorithm)).

Notebook shows how to add clutter and jitter endpoints to make nontargets.
